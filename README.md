## How to Use

1. Select your Armenian language level (A1-B2)
2. Choose your preferred quiz language (English or Russian)
3. Study 10 vocabulary words in learning mode
4. Take the quiz to test your knowledge
5. View your score and start a new session or change difficulty level

## Technical Details

- Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no build process required)
- Uses browser localStorage for persistent settings and progress
- Responsive design with modern CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Vocabulary database with 200+ Armenian words across difficulty levels
- Browser caching: `vocabulary.json` is cached by browsers using default caching behavior

## GitHub Pages Deployment

This app is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch. The deployment is handled by GitHub Actions workflow.

### Live Demo

Once deployed, the app will be available at: `https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]/`

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3 (for building vocabulary and running local server)
- Required Python packages (for building vocabulary):
  ```bash
  pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
  ```

### Building the Vocabulary

The vocabulary database (`vocabulary.json`) is built from multiple dictionary sources. Use the Makefile for convenient commands:

```bash
# Build vocabulary using caches (faster, default)
make vocabulary-build

# Build vocabulary without caches (rebuild everything)
make vocabulary-build-no-cache
```

### Running Locally

To run the app locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the vocabulary (if needed):
  ```bash
   make build
  ```
3. Start the local server:
  ```bash
   make serve
  ```
   Or manually:
4. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

## Caching Configuration

The vocabulary data is stored as `vocabulary.json` instead of a JavaScript file. Browsers typically cache JSON files more aggressively than JavaScript files by default, providing better caching behavior on GitHub Pages without requiring custom HTTP headers.

This approach works well with GitHub Pages since it relies on browser default caching policies rather than server-side cache headers.
